I have graduated high school as a system programmer. I have a professional qualification certificate level 3. I have learned Java, SQL, HTML, C++, C#, Java OOP, and PHP. I found that I have a passion for front-end development. After five years of studying system programming, I have decided to obtain my bachelor's in a different field, Communication and informational studies in Groningen, the Netherlands.
